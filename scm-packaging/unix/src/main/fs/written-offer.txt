Written Offer for Source Code:

Information on the license conditions and - if required by the license - on the
source code is available free of charge on request.
However, some licenses require the provision of physical copies of the source
or object code. If this is the case, you can request a physical copy of the
source code. A small fee is charged for these services to cover the cost of
physical distribution.

To receive a copy of the source code you can either submit a written request to

Cloudogu GmbH
Gark√ºche 1
38100 Braunschweig
Germany

or you may send an email to hello@cloudogu.com.

Your request must be sent within three years from the date you received the
software from Cloudogu that is the subject of your request or, in the case of
source code licensed under the AGPL/GPL/LGPL v3, for as long as Cloudogu offers
spare parts or customer support for the product, including the components or
binaries that are the subject of your request.
