Please use the internal import mechanism of the SCM-Manager to import existing repositories.
On the repository overview page, click "Add Repository" and then select "Import Repository"
on the top right corner. Now, you can choose what type of repository you want to import.

Next, you can choose whether to import from a URL (for Git and Mercurial) or from a dump
(Git, Mercurial and Subversion).

To import from a URL, you can specify the URL and the credentials for the existing repository.
The credentials will not be stored but are only used to access the existing repository once.

Below, you have to select the name (and maybe the namespace) and other metadata for your new
repository inside SCM-Manager.

For more information about importing and exporting dumps, please refer to the "Repository"
section in the user documentation.
